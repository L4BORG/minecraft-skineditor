Combining all the good stuff in HTML5 and make it into a snazzy tool for editing your Minecraft skin.

Of course, browsers conspire agin me with:

* Mojang needs to change their Cross-Origin permissions so you can actually send them your new skin.
* IE<8 not supporting: <canvas>, WebGL, image-border, HTML5 elements, @font-face
* Chrome has a weird sync bug where it wont always update the skin when you load it.
* Firefox has a similar weird sync bug if you use a different global composite mode.
* Chrome makes the @font-face ugly.

I made this ages ago to play with WebGL, but it was handicapped by the limited resources at Mojang putting zero time into their user/account system to allow people to easily update their skin. And also how terrible browsers were. They still are, but with a few more years behind them ‚Äê so time to update this. The above points are probably hilariously out of date, so update those too.

It has been hosted on gitorious at https://gitorious.org/mcse since I made it, and yet I still receive a few emails a month requesting access to source or payment for services to style it. Maybe putting it on github might reduce that? We shall see.
